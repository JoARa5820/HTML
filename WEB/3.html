        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.</strong>
            <br>While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
            <br>JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).    
        </p>
            This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments.
            <br>For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
        <p>
            The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402).
            <br>As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it.
            <br>This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features.
            <br>Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language â€” JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java".
            <br>Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries.
            <br>However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.
