            <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a <u>web browser</u>.</strong>
            <br>It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
            <br>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
            <br>With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
            <br>HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
            <br>HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
            <br>Tags such as "img /" and "input /" directly introduce content into the page.
            <br>Other tags such as "p" surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
            <br>Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
            <br>The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
            <br>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the "canvas" element, in collaboration with JavaScript.
